# Welcome to the Scoped Search Demo Application
This software is all about demonstrating the capabilities and usage of the 'scoped_search' plugin http://github.com/wvanbergen/scoped_search.
The socped_search is a Rails plugin that let a user easily search ActiveRecord models with a simple query language using a named scope. The scoped search can be used by the programmer as well as the end user. It includes a syntax auto completer to get the end users familiar with the query syntax.

## The Application, step by step
The demo application has two pages hosts and packages, a host has many packages and packages  belongs to a host. In each page there is a search bar at the top to allow the user to search for host and packages.
### Gem requirements
Scoped search runs on both Rails 2 and 3.
### javascript and css files
 The GUI part of the plugin can use Prototype or JQuery java-script library.
If you are using JQuery you'll need 'jquery.js' and 'jquery-ui.js' in the 'public/javascript' folder. You can find more info about JQuery here:
•	http://jquery.com/
•	http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/

Style sheets files are in the folder to the *public/stylesheets* folder on your app.  The styles that begin with .auto_complete are the ones that set the auto-completer widget style.
### Include the java script and style sheet files on your layout
On app/views/layouts/application.html.erb you should include the needed javascript files  for example you can use the following lines
    <%= javascript_include_tag "jquery.min.js", "jquery-ui-1.8.9.custom.min.js" %>
    <%= stylesheet_link_tag 'jquery-ui-1.8.9.custom.css' %>
